[Q1] Find the countries where more languages are spoken than in the country 
     with code 'MEX'.

     Report the code of the country (as attribute 'code') and the number of 
     languages spoken in the country (as attribute 'numlanguages'). Order does
     not matter.

     Hint: Find the number of languages spoken in 'MEX' and use that subquery
     in a HAVING clause. And remember that you must use single quotes on your
     strings in SQL.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH mex_languages AS (SELECT count(DISTINCT countrylanguage.countrylanguage) AS numlanguages
                       FROM countrylanguage
                       WHERE countrycode = 'MEX')
SELECT code,
       count(DISTINCT countrylanguage.countrylanguage) AS numlanguages
FROM country
         JOIN  countrylanguage ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode
GROUP BY country.code
HAVING count(DISTINCT countrylanguage.countrylanguage) > (SELECT numlanguages FROM mex_languages);



===============================================================================
[Q2] Find all countries where 'English' is the most commonly spoken language 
     (based on percentage). English doesn't have to surpass all other languages
     in the country; if it is tied for first place, that is sufficient. Note 
     that, for some countries, every percentage in the datase is 0, so English
     will satisfy the condition in a not very meaningful way. Don't do anything
     to exclude those countries.

     Report the country names only (as attribute 'country'); do not include 
     any duplicates.

     Hint: For each country, find the percentage for English and check 
     whether it's >= the percentage for all the other languages spoken there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH highest_language_percentage AS (SELECT countrycode, max(percentage) AS max_percentage
                                     FROM countrylanguage
                                     GROUP BY countrycode)
SELECT country.name AS country
FROM country JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode
WHERE countrylanguage.countrylanguage = 'English'
  AND countrylanguage.percentage = (SELECT max_percentage
                                    FROM highest_language_percentage
                                    WHERE countrycode = country.code);
